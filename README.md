# This-Is-Us
Volunteer-Match System

'This is Us' is a Django based Web App that connects Volunteers with Organisations. It allows users to register as Individuals or as Organisations, allowing the 'Individuals' to see all Volunteering Openings near them, and allowing the 'Organisations' to create Volunteering Locations.

UPDATE: 16th October 2019
Some parts of the project has been removed for moderation, will be updated soon.
