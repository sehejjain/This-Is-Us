# This-Is-Us
Volunteer-Match System

'This is Us' is a Django based Web App that connects Volunteers with Organisations. It allows users to register as Individuals or as Organisations, allowing the 'Individuals' to see all Volunteering Openings near them, and allowing the 'Organisations' to create Volunteering Locations.
